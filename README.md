# Product-Based Capstone "LeFlash" - AI-Powered Flashcard Web App 

# Executive Summary

Nowadays, students are required to learn effectively and efficiently. Factual knowledge fluency (accuracy and speed) itself is not only an important response competency, but also has a positive impact on retention and practice. Daily one-minute paper-based flashcard practice is expected to be effective in building students' competence in terminology identification. However, concerns regarding flashcard creation, durability, accessibility and student motivation have been raised. An alternative web and app-based AI-integrated flashcard learning assistant was designed to address these challenges. This research proposes an instructional shift in adapting electronic flashcards in teaching in various fields. LeFlash comes as a solution to this with machine learning and programming models that are designed to enhance the learning process.
